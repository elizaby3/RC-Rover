# RC-Rover

The goal of this project is to make a remote controlled rover from scratch. I am currently working on getting the PCB manufactured and wiring and soldering different components together.

## Current Progress
### Schematic and PCB Design

First I started out with making the schematic where the ESP32 board in the middle connects to a connection scoket for the joystick controller and two LEDs and resistors that I will eventually program to indicate when the remote controller is on or off.

After I had finished my schematic, I routed the PCB on Kicad and used a ground fill to connect the grounds as shown above.
